## Comments

- Between the framework choices the one I had already started learning is React, that's why I chose it. And I like it.
- I'm still learning React, and I had no experience whatsoever testing react components. So I learned a little
with the time I had just to start with some testing, but I still have to learn and practice testing
React components. I'm more experienced with Angular 1.x and testing with its environment, I can show
some stuff.
- In this case I didn't want to use architectures like flux/redux, but I have some example with
React + Redux in the BuyBox repo.
- This project was bootstraped through a boilerplate I created that is still in progress.
- I believe all the functions asked were covered by this project.
